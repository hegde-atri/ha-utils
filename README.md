# hegdeatri-util

This is a library that contains some of the common function I use while creating CLI tools, or just having fun in rust.

## Planned functionality

- Being able to execute a command, optionally in a specified directory or in the current working directory.
- Some helper functions that will be useful for advent of code 2023.
